# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This is my personal solution to the [Social links challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ/hub). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects and I enjoyed working on this project.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I did not necessarily learn much in this project but I reinforced my knowledge on css flexbox.

### Continued development

The areas where I think I'd like to improve is my understanding of positioning of elements in css. I want to be able to make the right decisions when placing elements whether it be with CSS grid or flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Css reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - this article taught me about CSS reset and a little bit more about css defaults.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - this website is what I used to make sure I used the correct selectors and available properties.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - I used chatgpt for small queries about my code where I couldn't necessarily see issues.
